# Go Artisan

Laravel artisan like boilerplate code generator CLI tools built with Go. Easy to configure and cutomize.

## FAQ

#### Why using goartisan if I can just scaffold initial project with `git clone` ?

It's personal preference, I just love to do many things directly in my terminal to reduce possible distraction and increase my focus.

## Installation

Go Artisan are CLI tools, it can be installed as an executable file or you can build it yourself.
It is different with all rounder framework like [Goravel](https://goravel.dev) which is a web framework built with Go. Go Artisan is just a CLI tools to generate boilerplate code, you own the code and you can customize it as you like.

### Simple installation

This will add `goartisan` to your environment variable and should be ready to use anywhere.

```bash
go install https://github.com/wahyusa/goartisan

# ready to use

cd my-project

goartisan init

goartisan make:model Book
```

## Default Configuration

WIP

## Is this works ?

As for now it's still in development so you can't use it yet.
